Target: Identify bad loans from the German credit data.

The loan application problem is a classification problem: you want to identify loan
applicants who are likely to default. Three common approaches in such cases are
logistic regression, Naive Bayes classifiers, and decision trees

```{r cars}
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)

load('GCDData.RData')
model <- rpart(Good.Loan ~
Duration.in.month +
Installment.rate.in.percentage.of.disposable.income +
Credit.amount +
Other.installment.plans,
data=d,
control=rpart.control(maxdepth=4),
method="class")
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
rpart.plot(model)
```
